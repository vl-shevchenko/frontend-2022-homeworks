**This PR contains irrelevant files.**

You can see this under [Files changed](./files) tab (you will find a couple of helpful tabs right under the PR title).

Most likely, you added all files from your project, not only required and sufficient code review as instructed in [section B123 of submission instructions](https://github.com/kottans/frontend-2022-homeworks#b1-%D0%B2%D1%96%D0%B4%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BA%D0%B0-%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B4%D1%83-%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE-%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8F-app). Also read an important note therein.

Why we want only few files?
1. It helps code reviewers to focus on code you authored and have the workspace uncluttered with irrelevant images and transpiled files.
2. This keeps homeworks repository small.
   For example, images add to the weight of the repo and will affect download/upload time for mentors and other students. We all care about others' time.

Please fix this issue by removing irrelevant files and add a **comment stating that you did this**.
